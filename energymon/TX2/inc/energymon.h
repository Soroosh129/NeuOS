/**
 * A common API for reading energy data.
 *
 * Pointers to implementations of the typedef'd functions below are included
 * in the energymon struct for encapsulation.
 * Energy reader implementations usually expose a getter function to populate
 * an energymon struct with their own function pointers.
 *
 * The typical use case is:
 *  1) Get the energymon using an implementation's getter function.
 *  2) Initialize the energymon (finit).
 *  3) Use energymon until no longer needed (fread, etc.).
 *  4) Destroy the energymon (ffinish).
 *
 * The behavior of operating on an uninitialized energymon is undefined.
 * Implementations make a best effort to verify initialization and return 
 * proper error codes (for example, by checking if the "state" field is NULL).
 * Errno should be set (or preserved) on failures.
 * Error messages may be printed preemptively if too much context would be lost
 * otherwise.
 *
 * Functions that take energymon pointers as a parameter usually fail if the
 * pointer is NULL or if the energymon is not initialized.
 * If the implementation does not require the pointer or the energymon to be
 * initialized, it may choose whether to fail or complete its task.
